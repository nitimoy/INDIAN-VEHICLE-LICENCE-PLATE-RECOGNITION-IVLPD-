# INDIAN-VEHICLE-LICENCE-PLATE-RECOGNITION-IVLPD

License Plate Detection and Recognition (LPDR) is a Computer Vision application that detects Indian license plates and recognizes them.
It can be used in parking lots, traffic control, public and private entrances, and theft control.
The project was built using Deep Neural Network (DNN) model and Open Computer Vision (Open CV) libraries.
LPDR uses Open CVâ€™s HAAR Cascades to preprocess the images and then using CNN recognizes the individual objects
which are then put into Long Short Term (LSTM) models to predict and recognize the complete patterns which are the numbers in the plates.
